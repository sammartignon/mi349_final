    <h2 id="biotitle">Who is Sam Martignon?</h2>
    <p class="biotext">As it is embarassing to write about myself, I will do it for the class.
        I am Sam Martignon, and to sum up my life into a word, it would be expectations.
        I have always been someone who people expect to be great. I say that in the
        most humble way I can because I don't see that in myself very often. I want
        to be sucessful and well liked of course, but I don't think its because I was
        really meant to be that way. My motivating factor in life (minus my faith) is 
        to live up to the expectations that have been placed upon me, which brings me to
        the list of things I have done with my life.
    </p>
    <ul class="titleslist">
        <li>Football Team Captain</li>
        <li>President of Student Government</li>
        <li>PAL, or certified therapist for High School students</li>
        <li>Kesem @ MSU's Development Coord, raising 150K</li>
        <li>Head of the Student Atheltic Council of Michigan</li>
        <li>Deans List and Honor Roll all years of Education</li>
        <li>Certfied Light Specialist</li>
        <li>Certfied Leasing Agent</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="biotext">This list is not meant to be impressive of me, but more to be impressive on
        how crazy others influences can be. I did all of these simply trying to live up
        to the people who believed in me. I have lived my life out of trying to make the 
        people who I love proud, and I will continue to put my best effort forward to do that.

    <p class="biotext">The picture above in my Dad. He has by far the biggest influence on my life, I want
        to become at least of the man he is. He is a computer scientist and although my love
        for programming is not very high, I want to be in the computer world thanks to my pure
        admiration for him. He is a great man, and as is son I am very proud of him. He also
        expects great things from me, but unlike everyone else, he understands that I have failed
        and that I always can't be great. He is one of the only ones in my life who not only comforts me 
        when I stumble, but encourages me to keep moving forward. He has taught me to accept failure,
        learn from it, and move forward to accomplish something <strong>I am</strong> proud of. He is truly
        my rolemodel, and my personal bio would not be complete without him.
