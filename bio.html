    <h2 id="biotitle">Who is Sam Martignon?</h2>
    <p class="biotext">As it is embarassing to write about myself, I will do it for the class.
        I am Sam Martignon, and to sum up my life into a word, it would be expectations.
        I have always been someone who people expect to be great. I say that in the
        most humble way I can because I don't see that in myself very often. I want
        to be sucessful and well liked of course, but I don't think its because I was
        really meant to be that way. My motivating factor in life (minus my faith) is 
        to live up to the expectations that have been placed upon me, which brings me to
        the list of things I have done with my life.
    </p>
    <ul class="titleslist">
        <li>Football Team Captain</li>
        <li>President of Student Government</li>
        <li>PAL, or certified therapist for High School students</li>
        <li>Kesem @ MSU's Development Coord, raising 150K</li>
        <li>Head of the Student Atheltic Council of Michigan</li>
        <li>Deans List and Honor Roll all years of Education</li>
        <li>Certfied Light Specialist</li>
        <li>Certfied Leasing Agent</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="biotext">This list is not meant to be impressive of me, but more to be impressive on
        how crazy others influences can be. I did all of these simply trying to live up
        to the people who believed in me. I have lived my life out of trying to make the 
        people who I love proud, and I will continue to put my best effort forward to do that.
        In all honesty, I am still very unsure of who I am or what I can do, but putting my best effort
        forward is all I can promise, and that is a honest promise.

    <p><img class="fampic" src="Father-Son.JPG" alt="Picture of my Dad and I"></p>
    <p class="biotext">The picture above in my Dad. He has by far the biggest influence on my life, I want
        to become at least of the man he is. He is a computer scientist and although my love
        for programming is not very high, I want to be in the computer world thanks to my pure
        admiration for him. He is a great man, and as is son I am very proud of him. He also
        expects great things from me, but unlike everyone else, he understands that I have failed
        and that I always can't be great. He is one of the only ones in my life who not only comforts me 
        when I stumble, but encourages me to keep moving forward. He has taught me to accept failure,
        learn from it, and move forward to accomplish something <strong>I am</strong> proud of. He is truly
        my rolemodel, and my personal bio would not be complete without him.
    </p>
    <p class="biotext">To lighten the mood, here is a couple fun facts about me! I am a huge fan of Star Wars and Game of Thrones.
        Star Wars will always be my favorite thing, but Game of Thrones in near unmatched when it comes to world building and 
        overall plot development. If you get to know me, I will sprinkle little Game of Thrones references in much of my day to day!
        So to end this bio, I shall honorably end my bio with the Night Watch Oath.
    </p>
    <p class="GOT">
        Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. 
        I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Nights Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.‚Äù
